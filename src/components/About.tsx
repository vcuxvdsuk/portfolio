                I’m a Software Engineer specializing in Backend and AI-powered
                systems. I enjoy building reliable services, designing clean
                architectures, and turning complex problems into simple,
                maintainable solutions. My background combines backend
                development (Node.js, Python, databases, APIs) with hands-on
                machine learning and data pipelines, allowing me to work across
                both infrastructure and intelligent systems. I’m naturally
                curious, fast to learn, and motivated by ownership, performance,
                and writing production-quality code.
